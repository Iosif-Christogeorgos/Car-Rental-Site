            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I was born in Greece with a big family of three siblings and two lovely hard-working parents and,
                despite
                the hindrances we give to each other, I still manage to get through life and appreciate the things and
                challenges I've been given throughout this journey. I'm the 2nd eldest child in the family, so when it
                comes to house chores it splits up between sibling to sibling and for me, it mostly comes to cooking and
                gardening. </p>

            <p>I have a variety of hobbies, but there will be times when I find myself slacking around,
                mostly doing nothing. My parents are devoted Christians, so sometimes on my weekends I indulge myself in
                youth church activities. I have an interest in music ever since I was a little. Luckily, I stumbled
                myself into the church's music ministry and learned piano along with friends who played other
                instruments. I also have an interest in computers, mostly playing video games and watching videos online
                and entertaining myself on the Internet world.</p>
