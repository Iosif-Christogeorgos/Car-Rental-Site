    <p class="description">
      I currently study at the university of athens Tech in the field of
      computer science. I am an 18 years old male, passionate about web
      development and proggraming.Growing up around technology, made me realise
      what I truly like doing for the rest of my life, it have tried a variety
      of fields in technology, including robotics, web developmen, ethical
      hacking and proggraming with python. I ended up mostly sticking with the
      last two. I love watching shows and movies endless hours especially with
      friends.
